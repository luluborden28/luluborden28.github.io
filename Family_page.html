  <p>I have an <strong>amazing</strong> family. My siblings are both older than me and both go to USC. My sister is a junior and my brother is a freshman. I also have an <em>amazing</em> dog named Turtle. She is five years old and an italian water dog.</p>
  <h3> Family traditions</h3>
    <p>For christmas, we <strong>always</strong>go to Santa Barbara because almost my entire family lives there. Both my parents grew up there, so it's the spot we always go. I also have a big family with 17 cousins and four of them are around my age!</p>
