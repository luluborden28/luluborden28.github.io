     <h3>Cooking and Baking</h3>
    <p> I really enjoy cooking and baking. It's a time for me to take a break from all my stress, that stems from school, sports and social life. Right now, it's just my parents and me at home, so making meals for the family isn't too hard. </p>
  <br>
  <p>Here are the links to some of my favorite recipes I use:</p>
     <li><a href="https://joyfoodsunshine.com/the-most-amazing-chocolate-chip-cookies/?scrlybrkr=564833cf">Chocolate Chip Cookies</a></li>
     <li><a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/vodka-pasta/">Vodka Pasta</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.tastesoflizzyt.com/homemade-cinnamon-rolls/">Cinnamon Rolls</a></li>

    <h3> Sports</h3>
   <p>I play lacrosse for highschool and club and field hockey only for highschool. I enjoy playing both of these sports, because it makes me feel more connected to Redwood, and I'm able to see friends I wouldn't normally see otherwise.</p>
